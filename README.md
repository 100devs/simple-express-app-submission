# Trader Joe's Product API

Basic API that will return JSON with information on that product.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js

Written in express with fairly basic functionality. Proof of concept for writing bigger API's that are product based for use in food, nutritional, and recipe websites.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned a good deal about deploying APIs. Opened my eyes to the many different endpoint options that can be created on the backend. Spending more time going forward thinking about building more robust paths for getting product data.
