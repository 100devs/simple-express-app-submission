## How It's Made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB
I focused on getting and recing data from the backend, and using API's to make an interesting project.
## Optimizations
I should use Express.js for the bacend to make it more readable and axios to retrieve data from APIs. Currently the code doesn't handle many errors from the YFAPI, this would be confusinf to a user.
## Lesson Learned
External APIs are really interesting to play with. You can easily retreive and manipulate data you otherwise would not have access to.
