ORDTAK (which means Proverb in Norwegian)

My mum loves proverbs, and she often answers with proverbs whenever she is asked something. 
I decided to make an app to store her most used ones and also give her as a birthday present.

**Check out live project:** https://ordtak.herokuapp.com/



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, EJS, MongoDB.

Building the app in Node and Express was a good choice for this app, since it was a quite small project which did not need too much. 

## Optimizations

I would have loved to add proverb categories and also a search function. I was also thinking of adding upvoting to the proverbs. I would maybe also consider remaking it in React if I was going to remake it. 

## Lessons Learned:

Although this was not a huge app to build, I learned quite a few lessons along the way. This was my first time using EJS and it took me a while to work out how to get it to render the document files properly. It was also a very good learning experience working with MongoDB. Quite a lot of debugging went into getting this app to work with Heroku. I was getting error codes and had to work out why the app was crashing everytime I tried to launch it.
