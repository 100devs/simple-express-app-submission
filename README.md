### Goal: Make Your Own CRUD APP and Push To Heroku

### How to submit your code for review:

- Fork and clone this repo
- Create a new branch called answer
- Checkout answer branch
- Push to your fork
- Issue a pull request
- Your pull request description should contain the following:
  - (1 to 5 no 3) I completed the challenge
  - (1 to 5 no 3) I feel good about my code
  - Anything specific on which you want feedback!

Example:
```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...
``` -->

**Instructions**
npm install
set up your mongoDB database and put the connection string into an .env file set to the variable DB_STR


<!-- I completed the challenge: 4
I feel good about my code: 5

I just need to add an edit function to complete the full CRUD.  Will be working more on it and may possibly be complete by the time it is viewed!  If it is full CRUD at viewing then my 4 would also be a 5.  I feel really good about the code as I learned a lot while making this application like deleting the correct document in mongoDB based off of the id instead of the name!
