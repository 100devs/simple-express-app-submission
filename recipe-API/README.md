# 5-Ingredient Recipe Lookup API
This is an API allowing CRUD operations that delivers recipe information suitable for displaying as a recipe card. It aims to help the world spend less time cooking, and more time connecting.

### :construction: This webapp is actively under construction! ###

## Some Notes:

**Tech used:**  Node.js, Express.js

I enjoy working with APIs so I decided to learn how to make them. This API will also be a part of a larger project in the near future. 

## Optimizations (Coming soon)

1. Migrating to Mongodb, because even Goku felt better on the cloud. 
2. Adding more recipes, and the cooking instructions. 
3. Rendering the recipes with EJS templating. 
4. Documentation, so everyone can use the API.
